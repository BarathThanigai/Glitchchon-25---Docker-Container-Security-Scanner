# Glitchchon-25---Docker-Container-Security-Scanner
Our project is an automated security scanner designed to continuously monitor Python projects for vulnerabilities, weak file permissions, and potential security risks. It integrates multiple security tools, including Bandit and Semgrep, to detect command injection, hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords), and misconfigurations.
